# How to contribute to Home Operating System

Love to get your contribution to the Anorak. In case you have a contribution, create a pull request and I will review it.

## General guideline

- Do not create major changes accross the whole HOS repo without agreement with the owner of the repo!
- A typical pull change would be a spesific feature or a new REST enpoint.
- Test to ensure there are no breaking changes in your contribution. In case there is, consult the owner of the repo before the pull request
- Add a detailed descripion of what you changed and why


## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
- Suggest your change in the HOS mailing list and start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

Thanks
